# My Rust Journey 🦀

This repository is my 'build-in-public' lab for learning the Rust programming language.

My goal is to go from "Hello, World!" to building high-performance, secure, and reliable systems for the decentralized web. This repo will contain all my notes, small projects, and solutions to exercises.

You can follow my thoughts and progress on **[X (formerly Twitter) at @_noahschroeder](https://x.com/_noahschroeder)**.

## Repository Structure

I'll be organizing my learning into a series of small, focused projects:

* **`/01-hello-world`**: The basics of Cargo, variables, and functions.
* **`/02-structs-and-enums`**: Exploring Rust's data types.
* **`/03-the-borrow-checker`**: (Wish me luck) Understanding ownership and lifetimes.
* *(More to come...)*
