# My Rust Journey 🦀

This repository is my 'build-in-public' lab for learning the Rust programming language.

My goal is to go from "Hello, World!" to building high-performance, secure, and reliable systems for the decentralized web. This repo will contain all my notes, small projects, and solutions to exercises.

You can follow my thoughts and progress on **[X (formerly Twitter) at @_noahschroeder](https://x.com/_noahschroeder)**.

## Repository Structure

I'm organizing my work into two main categories to separate learning from building.

### `/the-book`
This is where all my lesson-based projects live. I'm following a linear path, and the folders are numbered to show that progression.

* **`/01-getting-started`**: Getting Rust set up.
* **`/02-programming-a-guessing-game`**: First walk-through Rust project.
* **`/03-common-programming-concepts`**: Rust's take on standard programming concepts.
* *(More to come...)*

### `/projects`
This is my personal sandbox and project portfolio. These are independent projects I build for fun, to solve a problem, or to apply what I've learned from 'The Book.'

* *(No projects... yet!)*
